Zenboot - orchestrate your scripts
==================================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hybris/zenboot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hybris/zenboot)

## In a nutshell ##
* A kind of slim RunDeck with better Environment-support
* executing exactly the same in each environment just with another configuration
* Running scripts in chains, reuse scripts and maintain the configuration in key-value pairs
* Use it e.g. to provision manually, bootstrap your complete environment (puppet apply example coming soon)
* or fullfill your orchestration-needs, expose scripts via REST
* grails based 2.0.3

## Go with Docker

``` bash
./run-docker.sh
# login at localhost:8080 with admin/zenboot
mkdir -p zenboot-scripts/test/scriots
mkdir -p zenboot-scripts/test/plugins
# create your scripts and have fun
# modify zenboot.properties.Docker for e.g. DB-connection
```

## Installation on a debian based system in a nutshell ##

``` bash
apt-get update
apt-get install unzip git wget openjdk-7-jdk
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java
git clone https://github.com/hybris/zenboot.git
cd zenboot
./grailsw run-app
```

## Usage in a nutshell
* login at http://localhost:8080/zenboot with admin/zenboot
* Create a example-execution-zone: Processsing -> ExecutionZone -> Create
* Check enabled, create
* choose "helloworld" scriptdir, execute!
* Click the appeared Process on the left-hand-side
* Click on the callout in the Process-Output-column to see the output of the script
* Go again to the execution-zone, choose helloworld again, modify the value of "WHAT_TO_SAY", execute
* Examine the Output again
* Go again to the execution-zone, "edit" and add a key-value WHAT_TO_SAY -> "zenboot is cool!", update
* choose helloworld again, consider how the value has now been changed, execute
