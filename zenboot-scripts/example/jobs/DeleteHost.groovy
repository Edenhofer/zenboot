/**
 * Jobs can be triggered by exposed actions. A job needs to fit to the script-folder name which is set in the exposed action.
 *
 * Jobs can define how often the exposed action should be executed. This is done by defining the "before" closure and
 * to fill the jobContext with action object.
 *
 * The method ExecutionZoneService.createExecutionZoneAction will create an action for you using the exposed action object as template.
 * Parameters which will be used for this particular action are passed in the second method parameter.
 *
 * If needed, an "after" closure can also be defined in a Job class. This hook will be called after all actions are executed.
